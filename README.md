# üß† The Algorithmic Compendium: A Guide to Machine Learning

This repository serves as a comprehensive, organized reference guide to the fundamental and advanced algorithms used across the field of Machine Learning. It systematically breaks down algorithms based on the learning paradigm they fall under, from classical supervised learning to modern deep learning and meta-learning techniques.

Whether you are a student, a data scientist, or an enthusiast, this compendium is designed to provide clear explanations of core concepts and popular algorithms within each category.

## üóÇÔ∏è Table of Contents

The project content is organized into the following detailed guides:

| Category | Description | File Link | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **Supervised Regression** | Algorithms focused on predicting a continuous output value (e.g., predicting house prices). | [`01_ML_Supervised_Regression_Algorithms.md`](./01_ML_Supervised_Regression_Algorithms.md) | 
| **Supervised Classification** | Algorithms focused on predicting a discrete class label (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not-spam). | [`02_ML_Supervised_Classification_Algorithms.md`](./02_ML_Supervised_Classification_Algorithms.md) | 
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Algorithms used to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data without labeled responses (e.g., clustering and dimensionality reduction). | [`03_ML_Unsupervised_Algorithms.md`](./03_ML_Unsupervised_Algorithms.md) | 
| **Semi-Supervised Learning** | Algorithms that utilize a combination of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training. | [`04_ML_Semi-Supervised_Algorithms.md`](./04_ML_Semi-Supervised_Algorithms.md) | 
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Algorithms where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. | [`05_ML_Reinforcement_Algorithms.md`](./05_ML_Reinforcement_Algorithms.md) | 
| **Deep & Meta Learning** | Covers the architecture of neural networks, advanced techniques (like CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), and concepts in "learning to learn" (Meta-Learning). | [`06_ML_Deep_And_Meta_Algorithms.md`](./06_ML_Deep_And_Meta_Algorithms.md) |
